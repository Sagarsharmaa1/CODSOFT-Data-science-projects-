Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
Titanic Survival Detection Description: This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict survival probabilities. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, I aimed to uncover patterns and factors influencing survival rates. My approach and code for this task can be found on [GITHUB](https://github.com/Sagarsharmaa1/CODSOFT-Data-science-projects-/tree/main/task%201%20(Titanic_survival_prediction))
